The CropXR project utilizes SURF Research Drive as our Phase II platform for secure data sharing and collaboration. Our Research Drive is hosted at [https://cropxr.data.surfsara.nl/](https://cropxr.data.surfsara.nl/).

## Getting Access

Access to the CropXR Research Drive follows these steps:

1. **Request Access**: [Follow this link](../How-to-get-access.md)

- **Institutional Users**: If you're affiliated with a Dutch research institution, you can log in using your institutional Single Sign-On (SSO) credentials.

- **External Collaborators**: Researchers without institutional SSO can access the platform through EduID. If you don't have an EduID account yet, you can create one at [eduid.nl](https://eduid.nl). Use the browser to create your EduID account. The mobile version sometimes has issues.

3. **Account Activation**: After your request is approved, you'll receive an email invitation to the Research Drive. Follow the link in the invitation to set up your account.

4. **First Login**: Upon your first successful login, system administrators will configure appropriate access permissions for you based on your project role. This may take up to 24 hours.
