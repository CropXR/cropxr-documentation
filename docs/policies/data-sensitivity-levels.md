All data sharing is conducted through the DAC. Approval for sharing depends on the sensitivity level of the data. The DAC oversees five levels of data access:

| Access Level  | Description | DAC Approval needed for **CropXR** members? | DAC Approval needed for **non-CropXR** members? | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------|
| **Public** | Data accessible to everyone | No | No | No restrictions or monitoring required |
| **Internal** | Data for internal **CropXR** use | Yes | Yes | Approval needed to ensure data aligns with organizational use policies |
| **Restricted** | Specific individuals within **CropXR**, listed in data catalog | Yes* | Yes* | Access logged and monitored. Role-based access rights required |
| **Confidential** | Specific individuals, **not** listed in catalog | Yes* | Yes* | Limited to select individuals with specific security clearances |
