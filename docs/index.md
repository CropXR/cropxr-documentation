CropXR is an institute based in the Netherlands dedicated to developing 
more resilient crops through innovative ‘smart breeding’. Its mission is 
ambitious:

Through a solid foundation of Dutch plant biology, agricultural sciences, 
and plant breeding, the institute adds an integrated layer of experimental 
research, artificial intelligence and computational modelling. The goal is 
to develop technology and methods to generate new crop varieties that are 
better adjusted to climate change and less dependent on harmful agricultural 
interventions.
